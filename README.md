# Flutterbyte

Becasue why not.

## Everyone needs an annoying little bug to both pester them and provide them company while they work.

## Features
- Bright and rainbow-colored, really serving to distract
- Moves and jitters like a real-life bug around your screen
- If caught outside, it makes it's way back in
- Always on top of the world, pestering and demanding attention
- Hard to kill, just like a real bug! (Note: Currently a bug)
